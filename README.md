# Iris Flower Classifier


## Overview
Iris flower has three (3) species - Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. They differ according to their measurements, i.e., sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal of this project is to classify a sample Iris flower from the provided measurements according to the species by training an ML model that can learn from the [given dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabh00007/iriscsv) and do the classification.
